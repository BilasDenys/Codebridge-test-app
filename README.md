# Codebridge Test Application
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

Hi! I'm passionate like frontend developer from Ukraine. This application is part of test about my skills with Angular.

# What this application does ?

- Use with  [Angular ](https://angular.io/) framework
- Take some data from 3-th party API [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- Put to NgRx store and display it.
- For style UI I used [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
> **Note:**   For a neat way to unsubscribe from observables when the component destroyed I used [UntilDestroy](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy)

> **Note:** Used simple syncing between ngrx store and local or session storage. [ngrx-store-localstorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrx-store-localstorage)
